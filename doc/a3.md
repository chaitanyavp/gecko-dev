The bug I have chosen to fix is titled “"Clear Downloads" button in Library > Download has no accesskey”. This is an accessibility bug in Firefox. 

## Diagnosis:
The issue is that the clear downloads button does not have any keyboard key assigned to it (called an accesskey), and furthermore, the button cannot be selected by tabbing. This creates an issue where sightless users will have a hard time selecting with their accessibility software and will have a hard time clearing their downloads. One of the core tenets of Mozilla is inclusion and accessibility of software, so I believe fixing this bug is very important, as even something as simple as being able to clear download history would result in a more convenient experience for visually impaired users.
However, one possible risk of adding a keyboard shortcut to the clear downloads button is that regular users may press the key by accident and end up permanently clearing their download history, resulting in annoyances. That is why the UI also clearly indicates that the button has an accesskey, so everyone is made aware of it.

## Solution:
After taking a deep look at the code behind the downloads screen, I found some simple fixes to both problems with the clear downloads button. 
First, on line 122 of the “browser/locales/en_US/chrome/browser/downloads/downloads.dtd” file, we need to add a new line to set the accesskey of the clearDownloadsButton as “D”. 
After this, we must go to line 350 of the “browser/components/places/content/places.xul” file and set the accesskey attribute of the element to use the new one we just created in the other file. 
Now, the clear downloads button has an access key of “D”, and pressing Shift+D on the show downloads screen will cause the button to be pressed.
Fixing the tabbing issue is even simpler. On the same file places.xul, right under the new line we just added, we can add another new line that sets the tabindex attribute to 2. This causes the button to be the third element selected in order of tabbing, and forces it to become selected when we press tab 3 times.
From this, both issues should be fixed.

## Testing:
We can test the issue simply by opening Firefox, and following these steps:
1. Download any file so that we have a download history to clear.
2. Open Firefox Library window. (e.g. Ctrl+Shift+H)
3. In the left navigation sidebar go to Downloads.
4. Press tab a few times and confirm the button gets selected, and press enter to test it. Confirm the downloads get cleared.
5. Repeat steps 1-3, this time, instead of pressing tab, press Shift+D. Confirm that the downloads get cleared.
